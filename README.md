# Review Prediction: eCommerce Platform

## Overview

This project involves developing a predictive model for a major South American eCommerce platform, "Nile." The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave positive reviews, enabling the platform to target and incentivize these customers effectively. Positive reviews are crucial for maintaining a strong online retail presence, and this model aims to ensure that resources are used efficiently in encouraging customer feedback.

## Project Background

As part of an analytics consultancy team, we have been tasked with creating a pitch to secure a significant contract with Nile. The objective is to develop and deploy a model that predicts customer review behavior, specifically focusing on positive reviews. This initiative will help Nile maintain a robust set of positive reviews, which is vital for their business success.

## Data Description

We have been provided with a dataset consisting of 8 tables exported as CSV files, along with a file to translate product categories into English. The data can be joined according to a provided schema diagram. Our task is to appropriately join the necessary data tables for your analysis. Note that not all tables were needed to be included in our analysis.

## Task Objectives

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Joining the relevant data tables to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
   - Preparing the data for modeling, ensuring it is clean and suitable for machine learning.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Building a predictive model using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
   - Choosing one of the following approaches:
     - **Regression Model**: Predict star ratings as numerical values.
     - **Multi-Class Classification Model**: Predict star ratings as multiple classes.
     - **Binary-Class Classification Model**: Predict star ratings as above or below a threshold (e.g., "1-3 stars" or "4-5 stars").

## Goal

The ultimate goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts customer review behavior, focusing on positive reviews. This will enable Nile to strategically target customers for review incentives, optimizing their resource allocation and enhancing their online reputation.
